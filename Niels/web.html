<p> <a href="web_files/popquiz.html">This first quiz</a> is fairly random in terms of required knowledge. It is a completely unfair and biased and would never be used in a classroom setting. However, the questions should provoke a chuckle (I hope!) and the answer responses have been revised to have a bit more "flair". The point is that I adjusted the code as needed and showed deliberate changes in the content--which I believe is the point of this exercise. It also has 10 questions now. This was a bit of a challenge to figure out. I ended up re-reading the code and noticed the "var total" was set to 5. After setting to 10, then revising the "choice#" for questions 6 - 10, the quiz worked again.

<p><a href="web_files/drag.html">My drag-and-drop quiz</a> covers the completely useless trivia of which Starfleet officers served on which Starfleet ships in the fictional Star Trek universe. I modified the main fonts and background colors of the page and main container box. I also modified the labels and movable quiz boxes accordingly. I had a bit of trouble with modifying the items on the quiz as the tables were in a strange format. I assumed each line would contain a single ship, but that was not the case. Once I saved/revised/saved I figured out the problem and was able to correct.
